                Happy New Year!  For the first post of the year I want to talk a little bit about the "iPad Experiment" I started last year.
                <p>
                When iPadOS 13 was launched it came with a bunch of cool new features like mouse "support", split screen, and other new stuff with hopes
                of bringing the iPad a bit closer to a MacBook replacement.  Given the amount I (used to) travel, the idea was to bring just my iPad along with me 
                on business trips, leaving the heavy-ish 16" MacBook Pro at home.  Given that on most business trips I'm "consuming" content and rarely need to "create"
                anything, it seemed feasible.
                </p>
                  <strong>The set-up</strong>
                <p>
                  A liitle background info - last year there were three iPads in the range: iPad Pro, iPad Air, and regular iPad.  At the time the iPad Air was about $200 more than the regular
                  iPad, had a negligible screen size bump, slightly better performance, and still had the Home buton.  So for $200 extra it did not seem like enough of an 
                  upgrade.  And the Pro was (and still is) out of reach / not what I need.  So I bought the 6th generation iPad (the )
