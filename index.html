                Happy New Year!  For the first post of the year I want to talk a little bit about the "iPad Experiment" I started last year.
                <p>
                When iPadOS 13 was launched in 2019 it came with a bunch of cool new features like mouse "support", split screen, and other new stuff with hopes
                of bringing the iPad a bit closer to a MacBook replacement.  Given the amount I (used to) travel, the idea was to bring just my iPad along with me 
                on business trips, leaving the heavy-ish 16" MacBook Pro at home.  Given that on most business trips I'm "consuming" content and rarely need to "create"
                anything, it seemed feasible.
                </p>
                  <strong>The set-up</strong>
                <p>
                  A litle background info - in 2019 there were three iPads in the range: iPad Pro, iPad Air, and regular iPad.  At the time the iPad Air was about $200 more than the regular
                  iPad, had a negligible screen size bump, slightly better performance, and still had the Home buton.  So for $200 extra it did not seem like enough of an 
                  upgrade.  And the Pro was (and still is) out of reach / not what I need.  So I bought the 6th generation iPad (the 7th had not been released yet)
                  and paired it with a Logitec Logi keyboard case.   
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  2021 Update:  After recieving the 4th gen iPad Air for my birthday I have renewed faith that the iPad can make for a fabulous travel companion.
                  Given the new Air is more powerful than the old iPad Pro, there really is nothing it can't do.  The combination of iOS 14 and a mouse really makes it feel almost like the old 
                  11" Macbook Air.  I've also gone back to a "normal" case with the Apple wireless "Magic" keyboard.  Not sure was constitutes
                  magic these days, but it's just a nice aluminum Bluetooth keyboard.  No magic.  So although there is a bit of a weight penalty when travelling,
                  overall it' a more comfortable setup.  
                </p>
                <strong>Pros & Cons</strong>
                <p>
                  <strong>Pros</strong> - Lightweight, all-day battery life, great for consumming content & light work stuff.  After work it a great screen for Netflix and of course games.
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>Cons</strong> - I've realised most of the limitations I've encountered are related to the Apps themselves, not limitations of the hardware.  Mltitasking is very useful, but it's not perfect.
                  The Microsoft Office Apps are good, but still lack all the funcrionality of the desktop.  Teams in particular is missing the "Planner" functionality I sometimes need,
                  and Powerpoint seems to crash any time I try to re-size something.  But at least I've never lost work.  Hardware-wise you'll also be forced to use the 2nd gen Apple Pencil, so if you don't 
                  already have one that's an extra cash outlay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall I'm happy with the setup - for about 95% of the things I need to do it's a perfect travel companion.  And to honest, I'm rarely creating anything new on a business trip - I come prepared with 
                  what I need.  And if I need to update an Office file, no problem.  
                  <br><br>
                  Total cost of the 64 GB WiFi 4th gen iPad Air + Magic Keyboard + Apple Pencil + Magic Mouse (no case) would run you about CAD $1,340 plus tax.  By comparison, the latest 13" Macbook Air 
                  in the cheapest configuration runs CAD $1299 plus tax.  Food for thought.
