    One of the three new entrants to the hockey card market for the 1990-91 season was US card company Score. When these two sets were 
    first released - a bilingual Canadian set with a red Score logo on the card, plus an English-only American set with a blue logo - 
    I had absolutely no interest in collecting it.  In my mind it was far inferior to Upper Deck for a few reasons, 
    not the least iof which was the plastic flow-pack the cards came in.  Plastic.  In a year when Upper Deck was billing themselves 
    as <i>The Collector's Choice</i>, Score seemed like <i>The Kid's Choice</i> - serious collectors need not apply.

    Score's big coup before the '90-'91 season was the exclusive signing of <i>the</i> biggest prospect to hit the NHL since Wayne Gretzky,
    none other than Eric Lindros.  And while the way in which he finally made his way to the NHL was...unorthodox to say the least.  Let me 
    catch you up if you missed it the first time -  Lindros flat-out refused to report to the Quebec Nordiques after the team drafted him #1 overall. 
    So he sat out the year, played for his junior team again, represented Canada at the Olympics, and was ultimately traded to the Flyers...and The Rangers.
    The lawyers decided he should go to Philly, where he played his entire career.  More <a href="https://thehockeywriters.com/eric-lindros-trade-revisited/" target="_blank">here</a> if

    Anywho, Eric was a big deal, and the only place to get his rookie card was the Score sets.

    ...on to the set review...
</p>
<p>
    THe set itself continued with the trend of releasing gargantuan sets - in this case 440 cards plus another 110 via the mail-in only, yellow-bordered 
    Update set.  All told, the rookie class was huge.  In addition to Lindros, we had Jagr, Mogilny, Stevens, Richter, Modano, Joseph, Roenick,
    Sundin, Blake, Kolzig, and a big miss for the other sets - Martin Brodeur.  
</p>
<p>
    I have to say that over the years the set design has grown on me.  I actually like the clean white border, red header & footer, and the blue and red stripes 
    flanking each side of the card.  Player selection is great - they did have 440 cards to play with after all - but the photography was about average.  Compared 
    with Upper Deck (the new Gold standard) it was dark and less vibrant, but compared with O-Pee-Chee and Pro Set the player action shots were more 
    dynamic.  For the back of the card, Score kinda split the OPC max-stats approach vs. the Upper Deck minimalist approach right down the middle. They 
    included a second head shot of the player on the back of the card, with semi-minimal stats, but a pretty strong bio section. Backs were a decent pale yellow, with 
    a the addition of crossed Canadian and US flags at the bottom of the Canadian set cards.

    The set itself starts off with a bang - Gretzky & Lemieux are the #1 and #2 cards in the set.  Nice.  We continue with random player selection 
    until we get about three quarters of the way through the set when we hit the subsets - All Stars (with a neat little blur effect), All Rookie Team, Memorial Cup & Stanley Cup Champs 
    commemorative cards (the US set got a Hobey Baker Award card), "Skills" cards, Record Setters, Season Leaders, Hall of Famer, and final Award Winners. But the star subset, 
    similar in some ways to the famous Young Guns subset, is the NHL Prospect & 1st Round Draft Choice cards.  It is here we find the bulk of the rookie class, including 
    Jagr, Lindros & Brodeur.  The Prospect cards are a little nicer as the players appear on ice (even though some like Sundin appear in nation team jerseys) vs. the 
    Draft Choice cards which depict players - you guessed it - at the draft. Interestingly there were no checklist cards.  Industrious collectors at the time 
    could mail away for a checklist, which was just a regular 8" x 10" sheet of paper with the Score logo at the top and the words "1990 NHL Hockey Player List" at 
    the top.  Interestingly the list covered both the US and Canadian sets - indicating which cards were we US or Canadian only.  Kinda neat and pretty hard to find these days. 
    I do not have an original copy, nor have I seen one for sale. The set did not include any inserts either.  
</p>
<p>
    There were two and half ways you could build the set - card by card busting 15 card packs, or you could cheat and buy the full set as a "Factory Set". And the final 
    "rookies & traded" update set was only available as a mail-away.  The set itself was English-only, with a blue Score logo, and yellow rather than red top and 
    bottom borders, and card numbers contained a "T" suffix. THe Factory Set was the only place to get the 5-card Lindros "bonus" cards, picturing young Eric wearing a St. Michael's College 
    jersey, three in an Oshawa Generals jersey, and one in an OHL All-Star jersey. For super-fans only.

    Overall I have grown to appreciate this set - the design is pretty nice, has held up well over the years, the cards stock was premium-ish, the player selection was great,
    and the rookie class was strong - especially when you realise this was the only place to get a Lindros or Brodeur rookie card. Like most sets of 
    the era it is plagued by massive production numbers. The fact that it is still very easy to find large quantities or unopened factory sets for next to nothing, 
    has made the set worth very little, outside of the two marquee rookies.  But it actually make it a great opportunity to own a nice set, with a strong set of rookies,
    for not much more than a decent burger & fries.
