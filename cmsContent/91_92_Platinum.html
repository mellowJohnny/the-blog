    Pro Set Platinum really pushed the envelope in 1991 with their premium Platinum set. By this point it was obvious that 
    there was room in the hobby for "premium" sets, and Pro Set joined the fun with not one, but <i>two</i> premium offerings 
    for the 1991-92 season (the other was the resurrection of the Parkhust brand).  So, how far did Pro Set push the boundaries? 
    Not only were the cards high-gloss on both sides, but the front of the cards featured full bleed action shots <i>with no 
    player name</i>, or team logo, or position. Just an action shot and the silver Pro Set Platinum logo.  Bold? Brave? Stupid? Maybe 
    it's all three.  This is probably one of the more divisive set designs from the era - you either love 'em or hate 'em. I suppose 
    the idea at the time was to focus exclusively on the player - no other distractions (other than branding of course!) to take away 
    from the raison d'Ãªtre of a hockey card - to show the player.

	<strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The set itself was divided equally across two series of 150 cards each, which made collecting each series a fairly easy thing to do. Packs 
    contained 12 cards each, 36 packs per box.  Inserted into each series was a 10-card <i>Platinum Collectibles</i> set, for a total of 20 chase cards.
    The set was organised alphabetically by team, with about six or seven players featured per team, depending on the club. Subsets varied by Series, with 
    a 6-card <i>Platinum Performance</i> set and a 6-card <i>Original Six</i> set in Series I, and <i>Prospects</i>, <i>All Star</i>, <i>Performance</i>, 
    and <i>Celebrity Captain</i> cards in Series II.  The Series I <i>Performance</i> set featured a card for each divisional 
    champion, plus a card for Don Beaupre's as the league-leader in shutouts the previous season with five. The other six cards featured a static shot 
    of each team's 75th NHL Anniversary throwback jersey with hockey props!. The <i>Celebrity Captains</i> subset in Series II was an odd one. 
    Apparently the NHL designated a celebrity "fan" of the club to act as an honorary captain for the season, again in celebration of the 
    NHL's 75th.  Believe it or the Fred Rogers card is one of the more valuable in the set. Go figure. Weirdly there are only 12 "Captains" cards in the subset, 
    yet we had 23 teams that year. Series II cards is the only place we find rookies in the set, as there were none in Series I.  None. At all. At least 
    the names are the cream of the crop from that year - with Dominik Hasek, Nicklas Lidstrom, John LeClair, Tony Amonte, and Doug Weight leading the class.

    This set had real potential - but it has one fatal flaw. If you are going to bet the farm on a set design which puts the player (and 
    therefore the photography) front and centre, well, that photography better be world-class. You better have the very best shots & the very best digital 
    processing money can buy, so that player leaps off the card and right into your kitchen.  But that was not the case.  In fact it was mostly the exact opposite - 
    cards were more often than not under-exposed, occasionally out of focus, and the shot selection left a lot to be desired.  Craig Janney's card for example is a shot of two Boston 
    players side-by-side.  Who should I be looking at?  Which dude is Craig Janney? And if you look closely at Petr Svoboda & Kirk Muller's cards - they are 
    side-by-side in the set - you'll notice they were taken from the same spot at the same game. Both player shots are in front of the same Air Canada advertising, 
    in front of the same section of stands with <i>the same guy</i> in the background. Lazy?  Yeah, kinda.  
</p>
<p>
    But it's not <i>all</i> bad though. Turgeon's card is awesome, as is the shot of Bill Ranford.  Patrick Roy's landscape shot stopping Kip Miller in-close is 
    great, so is Kay Whitmore's toe save, and Kirk McLean flashing the leather.  But overall there are more forgettable cards than there are unbelievable 
    cards.  If the majority of the set looked like these, it would have been a real classic set. 
</p>
<p>
    I'm going to go out on a limb here and also suggest the backs of the cards were kinda ground-breaking too - the secondary player shot was another game 
    action shot, and took up about two thirds of the card.  It is here you find the player's name, position, team, card number, and small player fact. No 
    stats. None. At all. Players were also given a "sub-titles" under their names - <i>Platinum Performer</i> for regular player cards, <i>Platinum Prospect</i> 
    for rookies & sophomores, <i>Platinum All Star</i> for, you guessed it, All Star Team members, and finally more <i>Platinum Performance</i> cards.

    It's interesting to me that two card sets in 1991-92 came to market with full-bleed cards - Topps with Stadium Club, and Pro Set Platinum.  
    While the two sets are similar in design, the two could not be further from each other in execution. The Platinum set was ground-braking in it's 
    design, but fell flat with the execution.  Player shots were under-exposed and confusing, Series I had exactly <i>zero</i> rookies, and they printed
    and printed and printed. I still have a Series II box unopened. For me this goes in the "curiosity" bucket - interesting, maybe has a bit of 
    historical value, but that's about it. No wonder Pro Set only release it once.
