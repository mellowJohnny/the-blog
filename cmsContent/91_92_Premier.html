    If there's one thing you can count on in the business world it's capitalising on past success.  Hollywood is masterful at 
    producing sequels for just about any movie that does well, and O-Pee-Chee was no different in 1991-92 with the release the follow-up 
    to their wildly successful '90-'91 Premier set. If you recall, the inaugural set was a premium 132-card affair, limited-ish, 
    and most importantly loaded with rookies.  Unfortunately the '91-'92 was none of those things, except for being premium.  The set had grown to 198 cards 
    and of the 22 rookies featured in the set the biggest was Hall of Famer Nicklas Lidstrom.  That was it. Sure, we had minor stars like John LeClair, 
    Tony Amonte and Doug Weight, but that was about it for rookies. So to recap...bigger set than the year before, OPC printed a shit-ton of it based on 
    the popularity of the first Premier set, and Lidstom was the only rookie worth talking about.  <i>Awesome.</i></p>
<p>
    Which is all kind of a shame actually, because OPC managed to put together a really decent set despite it's lack of collectability.

	<strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This was again OPC's premium offering, and as such continued with crisp white high-quality card stock, a similar design to the previous set.  The 
    gold header displaying the OPC & Premier band logos appears once again, along with team colour coordinated side bars, and a nice big, shouty all-caps font at the foot of 
    the card for the player name, plus an almost microscopic team name and position.  All-in-all though it left a lot of room for the player photo, which 
    continued to improve.  No doubt Upper Deck's photography forced everyone to step up their photography game, which benefitted us all. That's not to say there are no under-exposed cards, 
    and OPC had not embraced digital colour correction yet, but things were on an upward trajectory. The card backs again featured a player head-shot (and were glossy this time around), 
    some condensed stats, a massive team logo, and a huge "1992 Premier" graphic running up the right side. The set was again organised in the now universally accepted random 
    player selection format.  In addition to having 66 more cards in the set (remeber that for later), O-Pee-Chee also broke from last year's set by including an "Original Six" 
    subset, sprinkled throughout the final 64 cards.

<p>
    The 1991-92 season was the NHL's 75th anniversary, and they celebrated by asking each of the Original Six teams (Montreal, Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and Detroit) to contribute  
    with some pretty decent throw-back jerseys.  Detroit brought back the red stripes from their 1928 unis, Boston rocked a jersey design from 1933, Chicago, the Leafs and the Rangers 
    brought back their 1940 jerseys, and Montreal paid tribute with a jersey design from 1926.  Which was lame, because if you are a hard-core NHL fan you'll 
    know the Habs jersey has largely stayed the same for 100+ years.  Why not bring back some of Montreal's truly different jerseys like 1945-46?  Or the "barber pole" jersey from 
    the 1912-13 season?  Missed opportunity. Anyway, the subset contained 6 extra cards for each team (a total of 36 cards for those of you who suck at math) showcasing a current player 
    in the throwback jersey. Cards chronicled each team's history - a card with the history of the team name, draft choices, all-time stats for goals & assists, as well as Stanley Cup championships and 
    "banners" for things like division & conference wins.  It also gave us essentially two Lidstrom rookies cards depending on how you are scoring at home - his regular player card as well 
    an Original 6 card. IN my book a player get <i>one</i> rookie card per set, not multiple.  But you do you. This was also the first year we got to see the newly-minted San Jose Sharks 
    team appear in their new teal jerseys - in fact OPC wasted no time, putting Doug Wilson in the set at card #6

    So what we have here is classic Junk Wax - the combination of excess production and a weak rookie class has condemned this set 
    to the bargain bin. The upside is the set can be had for dirt cheap.  Hell you can even find unopened boxes for a decent price and 
    put the set together the old fashioned way if you want.  Just be aware that you'll need <i>at least</i> two full boxes (maybe more) to 
    put a whole set together.  The key to remember is the set size - 198 cards.  OPC typically printed 132 cards to a sheet, meaning it is 
    extremely likely that 66 of the cards in the set were double printed to create a third single sheet.  But hey, if you get a deal on a few boxes and 
    like rippin' packs, fill you boots.  It's a decent set and can if you can put one together cheaply it's worth having.
