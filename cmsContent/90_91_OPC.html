	By the time the 1990-91 NHL season rolled around the landscape of the hockey card market in Canada and the US had changed seismically. O-Pee-Chee and Topps no longer held monopolies in their respective markets. The new NHL licensing deal was this: Upper Deck, Score and Pro Set had all been given the rights to produce two sets each, over the course of the season. Upper Deck did a "Low" series and a "High" series (in French and English), Score did a bilingual Canadian set and an English set for the US (plus a mail-in "traded" set only available in English), Pro Set did a Series I and Series II and Topps issued its regular set plus a premium Bowman set. Meanwhile, O-Pee-Chee released their regular set, and stunned the market with the mid-season release of a new, single series 132-card premium set called O-Pee-Pee Premier as their 2nd set. But more on that later. This was also the first year O-Pee-Chee released a full "Factory Set" (regular and Premier), probably to capitalize on the speculators driving demand. So the Canadian hockey card market went from a single OPC set in 1989-90 to five or six the next year, depending on how you count it (Bowman was available in Canada).

	<strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The 1990-91 O-Pee-Chee was their biggest set ever - a massive, meandering, over-produced set weighing in at 528 cards. Plus a 22-card "Central Red Army" insert set. And the Topps set was an equally massive (historically speaking) 396 card affair. Where to start...
</p>
<p>
	Let's start with the set quality! The card stock is thin. It seems like OPC tried to do a semi-premium card with an all white stock (front and back), but the cardboard was so thin it felt like thick paper. And over time it has not held up too well, with a tendency for the backs to get weird brown spots all over them, looking like they've rusted. All of this blows my mind a little bit, because that same year O-Pee-Chee also produced the stunning O-Pee-Chee Premier set, which suffered from none of these issues. Cards continued to be packaged in wax wrappers (with gum!) containing 9 cards, and cost 45 cents per pack. Interestingly the wax wrapper design remained unchanged again, recycling (or building brand identity, however you look at it) the design which had been used since it's debut in '85-'86.

	The set kicks off with three Gretzky cards, commemorating his 1851st point. Card #1 was also the first card to show Wayne in an Indiana Racers jersey. Then we get a three card "1990 Highlight" subset before the set starts in earnest. O-Pee-Chee once again follows a familiar pattern of random player selection, with the occasional Team card chronicling achievements from the '89-'90 season. In terms of subsets, we get "All Stars" capturing last season's 1st and 2nd Team selections, "Soviets vs NHL" highlighting some of the players from Dynamo Riga (where you'll find Arturs Irbe's RC) and the Soviet Wings who toured the NHL the previous season. Continuing the Soviet flavour, we were also treated to the Red Army insert set, one card per pack. If you are old enough to remeber the all-powerful Central Red Army team - the Soviet Union's All-Star team - played exhibition games in 1989 and 1990 against 12 NHL teams, posting an 8-3-1 record. Highlights? How about a card for coach Viktor Tikhonov! All that and we still got gum and a wax wrapper!

Set was design was a bit busy, especially compared with the realtively clean design of the year before. Between the rounded rectangle at the bottom displaying the player and and position and the return of the hockey stick graphic at the top of the card, plus a massive white border, there is not much room left for a photo. And that stick graphic seemed to always look like it was clobbering the guy in the head. Border colors mimic the team's colours, which for the most part looks pretty good. Card backs were white for the very first time, predominantly minty-green with navy highlights. The back of each player card features the return of the usual O-Pee-Chee format with full regular season & playoff stats, bio, and blurb. As for photography, I had a pretty hard time finding cards for my set awards - this from a set of 528 cards! Photos are generally uninspired, again looking like more of them were taken during warm-up. Lots are way to dark. Just wait 'till Upper Deck shows up with their stunning photography and digital colour processing.

Let's take a moment to talk rookies. There are 169 in the set. Yes, 169. Granted, not all are Hall of Famers, but there are few stand-outs including Jeremy Roenick, Slava Fetisov, Alexander Mogilny, Sergei Makarov, Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, Mark Recchi, Mike Richter, Rod Brindâ€™Amour, Mike Modano, Igor Larionov, Eric Desjardins and Arturs Irbe.

It was also the year the Russians came in large numbers to the NHL. Under Gorbachev's policy of Glasnost ("Openness") no less than 10 players hit the ice for NHL teams in the 1989-'90 season. For the first time we saw Soviet stars like Sergei Makarov, Vladimir Krutov and Igor Larionov (the famed KLM Line) don NHL jerseys. And let's not forget other Soviet super-stars like Alexei Kasatonov and Slava Fetisov. But we'd need to wait until the 1990-91 sets came out before their likenesses appeared on cardboard. Even though some of the guys were in their early 30s, the 1990-91 set boasted "rookies" from those glorious 80s Red Army teams. In fact, Sergei Makarov, the '89-'90 Rookie of the Year at the tender age of 32, was pretty much responsible for the Calder rule change - a "rookie" now had to be 26 yrs old or younger to be eligible. No more old guys.

	On the whole it seems like OPC was chasing their tails with this set. I've got to imagine while the "A" team was working on the Premier set, the "B" was working on this. Maybe not, maybe they did them sequentially (Premier was released pretty late in the season) but seemed rushed. And while it is certainly not the worst set of the season, it's not the best either. And maybe that's what OPC wanted - a set of wax-wrapped cards with gum for kids to spend their allowance on at the rink or corner store.
