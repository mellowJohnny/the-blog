    Not to be out-flanked by basically every other card company who introduced a "premium" card set, Topps brought their 
    premium <i>Stadium Club</i> offering to the hockey card market for the 1991-92 season.  Boasting Kodak print technology, Topps 
    aimed to take a piece of the (likely more profitable) premium market card market from rival Upper Deck, and maybe even OPC. 
    This was the second full-bleed set released that season - the other being the Pro Set Platinum set - but unlike the Platinum set 
    had a distinctly more traditional vibe to it.  Yes, the cards boasted player shots which stretched from edge to edge (no mean feat 
    actually), but still had player names inside a traditional blue band across the bottom, flanked by a gold-embossed 
    stripes and Stadium Club logo. At the time gold embossing was somewhat new and really did feel special, but Topps had a fairly 
    hard time keeping the quality up - more often than not the gold Stadium Club logo was not exactly sharp & defined. But here's to 
    pushing the envelope!

    <strong>On to the set review</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Being a premium set, the card quality is quite good - card stock is decent, and with full-bleed cards you basically can't tell if 
    the card is off-centered. The only issues are again with gold leaf - most of the time it fine, but like I said, it was not always perfect. There 
    are also well-documented variants of cards with no Sporting News logo on the back. The set came in at 400 cards, with 12 in each pack.  
    Kinda par for the course at the time. Player shot selection was also hit or miss. I think Topps really tried to emulate Upper Deck's 
    approach of pushing the envelope in terms of composition - different angles, different lenses, overhead shots, shots from the dressing 
    room, etc. So cards like Gretz after a game in the middle of a media scrum, Tom Barrasso with the Cup or Nieuwendyk tying his skate 
    were kinda cool. There were lots of shots that still suffered from under-exposure, but overall the set looked really good.

    Where the set falls down completely is the lack of rookies - there were only 12 <i>total</i>, and the lack of subsets. I'm a bit dumfounded at how the Score Pinnacle set featured 36 rookies. 
    And it's not like the 12 they had were the cream of the crop - there's no Lidstrom, no LeClair, no Amonte, no Weight, not even Adam Foote...mind blowing. All 
    was not lost though, they had André Racicot. No offence André. Plus no subsets?  I guess you either are a fan or not, and I/m firmly in the 
    "you outta have at least a couple" because in my mind hockey sets act as a historical record of a particular season, so year, I'd like to see 
    who won the awards, who made the All Star Team, and who broke some records the previous year.

    So the fact that Topps 100% missed the boat on the rookie class seems all the more bizarre when you realise the card back data was produced 
    in partnership with <i>The Sporting News</i>. Surely the guys on the scouting desk would have tipped the Topps folks off? And speaking 
    of the card backs, they were in complete contrast with the modern look of the front of the card. For some reason the backdrop was a hand
    drawn artist representation of the inside of an arena.  There was still a dearth of stats, but I really liked was the rookie card picture each player had. 
    Especially the rookies in the set - somehow Topps managed to put a picture of the front of the card on the <i>back</i> of the <i>same</i> card. I'm easily amused...

    I've always loved this set - the full-bleed is awesome, there are some really great player shots, and the quality is great. But 
    there are essentially no rookies, no subsets, and no inserts. So depending on what you value in a set, this may or may not be for you.
    But it was pretty hot at the time, and overall the design has really held up well. So if you subscribe the the old adage <i>collect what you like</i>, 
    and you like the set, then collect it.  It may not be worth the paper it's printed on (you can pick up full boxes for around $25), but 
    I think the inaugural set is always worth having.
