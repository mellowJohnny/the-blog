    1989-90 would turn out to be a watershed year for O-Pee-Chee. The times, as they say, were a changin'. The size of the set was increased for the first time since the 1984-85 set (to 330 cards), and this was the last season that O-Pee-Chee and Topps had exclusive rights to produce hockey cards in Canada and the US respectively. Once again the O-Pee-Chee set mirrored the first 198 cards of the Topps set, with the additional 132 cards focused mainly on the Canadian-based teams. This means OPC was the only set to feature the rookies cards of Gary Roberts, Theoren Fleury, Shane Corson, former Habs GM Marc Bergevin, and Ron Tugnutt.

    Back in the day I actually chose to build the Topps set instead of the O-Pee-Chee set for a few reasons: the card shop I worked at was bringing in unopened wax boxes, the set was only 198 cards vs. 330 for OPC, Topps packs had 13 cards vs. 7, and production for Topps was rumoured to be "lower" than OPC. Topps also had inserts - 12 All-Star and 21 "helmet" stickers, one for each team in the league, each with the team logo and two number stickers. Weird. As it turns out that lower production metric was essentially irrelevant, as each company still printed a crap-ton of cards, so...ultimately it makes no difference. Only later did I also build the OPC set, because, well, it was OPC and I didn't have it. Today this is the only year I have both the O-Pee-Chee and Topps sets.

    <strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned the 1989-90 set comes in at 330 cards, 132 more than last season - one full sheet on the printing press. Part of that extra set size was used to not only expand the number of players included, but also allowed OPC to bring back three sub-sets - '88-'89 Team Stats, Trophy Winners, and '89 Highlights, one of which honours the 1988-89 Stanley Cup winning Calgary Flames. And like last year, card #1 is Mario Lemieux. Nice. As mentioned, wax packs had just 7 cards per pack (again), making collecting this set a pain. Packs were again just Â¢0.35 at the time, with 48 packs in a box.
</p>
<p>
    As for rookies, this set is also quite stacked, and while there is no Lemieux or Roy, Joe Sakic and Brian Leetch are far and away the top of the class. There is also a strong supporting cast of secondary rookies not to be overlooked - Theoren Fleury, Trevor Linden, Kirk McLean, Gary Roberts, Cliff Ronning, Jon Casey, Tony Granato, Craig Janney, and Shayne Corson. Not too shabby.
</p>

    As for the card design I have always found it to be a bit dark - a medium-blue border top & bottom, and a bluish-gray border left & right meant to look like ice. Player names appear at the bottom of the card in a bright yellow box, while the team logo appears in a white circle to the right of that. The O-Pee-Chee logo appears at the top of the player photo, to the left or right depending on the shot. This is also the last year that we got a "tradional" card - glossy-ish front with a plain cardboard back, printed on the usual Tembec stock. This season we got a red geometric / angled shapes, again with the usual player name, number, personal stats, complete NHL record, playoff record, and blurb. Checklist cards are a nice bright yellow front and similar red back. Quality-wise the set is pretty good compared to previous years. In general cards are cut pretty well, but that blue border at the top and bottom makes it pretty obvious when a card was a bit mis-cut. No real issues with the edges either. Overall quite good.

    Once agin there is no real order to the set, except once we get past the checklist at #198 and venture into the exclusive OPC cards. For some reason the first three cards are US teams (LA & Buffalo), but then we get seven Calgary Flames cards (except Fleury - he's mysteriously the meat in a Edmonton Oilers sandwich). Then more US teams mostly grouped by team, but not alphabetically. Wait, did I say *not* alphabetically? Then we get Montreal, New Jersey, New York Islanders & Rangers. Then we cruise through Philly, Pittsburgh, Quebec, St. Louis, Toronto, Vancouver & Winnipeg. so...back to the alphabet, but with the occasional LA & Detroit player cards thrown in to keep you wondering if you forgot to take your meds. Wrapping the set up we get a stats card for each team highlighting their 1988-89 results (all in landscape, showing random players in game action), six Trophy Winner cards, five '89 Highlights cards and a final checklist round out the set. Let me stop and catch my breath here...

    I was a really big fan of the '89 Topps set - at 198 cards is was tight and focused. Looking at the OPC set as a whole, the addition of Theo Fleury, Kirk MacLean plus a few other minor rookies is nice, but the real selling point for me in the expanded O-Pee-Chee set is a feature I rather enjoy - the Team Stats and Award Winner cards are a nice historical addition, and I find when previous sets omitted them it felt a bit thin.

Overall the O-Pee-Chee set seems a bit more complete and given today there is virtually no premium between the two sets, picking up the OPC version is probably what I'd do. Then add a high grade slabbed Topps Sakic & Leech and you've covered all the bases. Or pick up both - they're cheap.
