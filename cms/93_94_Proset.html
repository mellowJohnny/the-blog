This set reminds a bit of the classic Greek <i>Comedy & Tragedy</i> theatre masks. Happy, because Pro Set had finally put a decent set together. Sad, because 
it was their last. Ironic? Maybe. Either way I still really love this set - sure, it was massively produced, but regardless, it a really decent set. As for production, 
I read somewhere 8,000 20-box cases were produced, plus another 2,000 20-box jumbo pack boxes, totally somewhere around 111 million cards. For a 270 card set
that would yield about 412,000 sets in all.

...on to the set review
</p>
<p>
Similar to other sets from this season, Pro Set decided to organise alphabetically by team, which I like a lot. Other than the first two cards - Pro Set awarded 
their <i>NHL Pro Set Player of the Year</i> to Mario Lemieux and the <i>Goalie of the Year</i> to Patrick Roy - the set kicks off with the Boston Bruins and ends the 
Winnipeg Jet. After that the subsets kick in - <i>Rookies</i>, <i>Statistical Leaders</i>, <i>Newsreel</i>, <i>Milestone</i>, <i>Play Smart</i> and finally <i>Trophy Winners</i>. 
Pretty good coverage actually. Interestingly Pro Set planned on releasing this set in two series' (card packs even said "Series I" on them), but bankruptcy prevented the 
release of the second series. So this is all we got - a 270 card set, Pro Set's swan song.

The card design and quality puts this set firmly in the "psudo-premium" category (yeah, I made that up) - it's not as slick as the Fleer Ultra set from the same year, but it's not complete trash
like the two previous Pro Set issues were.  Cards had a nice low gloss / matte finish, decent player shots, and clean design. Player names ran down the left of the card, with team colour matched
font colours. A decent sized team logo appeared at the bottom of the player band, while the Pro Set log sat at the top of the band. The rest of the card was a full-bleed player shot.
Which was not new for Pro Set, but the design came together nicely. Continuing on with the "old school" approach, card backs a player headshot, with full stats (!) and a player bio.
What more do you want? Overall, really solid. In hindsight though it does strike me as a wee bit lazy - Pro Set used a very similar card design for both the 1991-92 & 1992-93 Parkhust sets, so internally they were 
not exactly pushing the envelope.  
</p>
<p>
As for inserts, there were four: a 5-card <i>Award Winner</i> set, a 12-card <i>1991-92 Rookie Goal Leader</i> set, and a 15-card <i>1991-92 Team Leader</i> set, and a 5-card preview set for the upcoming 
1992-93 Parkhurst set.  That one I don't get - the inaugural Parkhurst set was released the year before, so...other than showing the new card designs, what was the point?

So...you won't be adding this set to your collection because it's rare, or because it's stacked with rookies, or even because the inserts are fabulous. No, the reason you'll want this set 
is because it's a bit of a curiosity - no other card company in history went belly up in the <i>middle</i> of a season. So without even knowing it, this was Pro Set's very last hockey set.
One one hand it's a bit sad, but on the other hand you gotta think they had it coming. To me no other manufacturer represented the frothy excess in the hockey card hobby like Pro Set. The poster child for 
How Not To Do It.
