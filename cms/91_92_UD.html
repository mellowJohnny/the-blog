    Other than the 1977-78 O-Pee-Chee set I started as a child (and finished as an adult), the 1991-92 Upper Deck set was the
    first card set I collected. What drew me in, like a lot of other collectors, was the quality of the cards. Just like the inaugural 
    '90-'91 set the player shots were unlike you'd see in any other set, and the digital image correction made the cards jump off the cardboard - 
    even if some cards did lean a little too heavily on colour saturation. But it was also the beginning of the dirty marketing tricks designed to 
    get collectors to buy more cards - random inserts which differed between regular and jumbo packs, legendary card collation which produced an 
    insane number of doubles, and "High Series" packs which were a mix of "low" and "high" cards. It was an arms race between the cards 
    companies with only one winner - Upper Deck. It was the beginning of the end.

    How bad was the insert set mania? Well, we had one Short Print (SP1 - Glasnost On Ice), a 9-card Award Winner hologram set, an 18-card 
    Euro-Stars set (only available in Jumbo packs), and the 11-card Hockey Heroes set featuring Brett Hull (which came with it's own un-numbered header card).
    That's 39 insert cards. Yikes. Truthfully, I do really like the hologram set, so at least they did it right.  The Hull and Euro-Stars? Not a fan.
