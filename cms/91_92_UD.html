    Other than the 1977-78 O-Pee-Chee set I started as a child (and finished as an adult), the 1991-92 Upper Deck set was the
    first card set I collected. What drew me in, like a lot of other collectors, was the quality of the cards. Just like the inaugural 
    '90-'91 set the player shots were unlike you'd see in any other set, and the digital image processing made the cards jump off the cardboard - 
    even if the colour on some cards did look a little over-saturated. Didn't matter, they looked awesome.</p>

<p>...on to the set review</p>

<p>
Before I talk about the set, I want to spend a minute talking about our friends at Upper Deck. I always felt like the '91-'92 set was the beginning of a marketing arms race started the year prior. Upper Deck's Marketing team seemed to have been hell bent on getting collectors to buy more cards. 
And you are right to point out that <i>is</i>their job. And yes, I realise Upper Deck is not a charity, and neither were any of the other card companies. But it felt like the spirit of collecting has been violated. Somehow collecting had grown up. <br>
Roughly speaking here's the playbook: 
<ol>
    <li>Increase the size of the set. The bigger the set, the more cards you need to buy.</li>
    <li>Collate the cards in such a way as to increase, as much as possible, duplicates</li>
    <li>Inserts! For those wanting a "complete" set, chase cards are a great way to get you to rip more packs. Oh, and make one of the insert sets only available in Jumbo packs!</li>
    <li>Release a "High Series" whose packs contain a <i>mix</i> of both "High" and "Low" Series cards</li>
    <li>Print a shit-ton of cards</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
So yeah, if you wanted to complete a set purely buying boxes and ripping 12-card packs, it would cost you a small fortune. Let's also remember the set is <i>700 cards</i>. 700.
Of course this was not how most people hand-collated sets - you'd buy a box or two, then head down to the local card shop or hit up the Sunday card show and grab the cards 
you were missing. But still, to me it was a bit dirty - especially the "High" / "Low" series mixed packs. It also felt like the beginning of <i>Insert Mania</i> - with a total of 39 inserts in the set.
There was SP1 (Glasnost On Ice), a 9-card <i>Award Winner</i> hologram set, an 18-card <i>Euro-Stars</i> set (only available in 17-card Jumbo packs, one per), and the 11-card <i>Hockey Heroes</i> set featuring Brett Hull 
which also came with it's own un-numbered header card. So I guess that's 40 cards then, ain't it. Yikes. At least the holo set looked decent, but the Hull and Euro-Stars? Meh. Hull was hot at the time, but nobody much cares now.
</p>
<p>
But don't get me wrong - it really is a great set. All my complaints really are purely monetary. What really saves this set is the awesome photography, excellent subsets, and strong rookie class. The card design was a little cleaner
in '91 than it was the year prior, with cards sporting a clean white border with the UD logo in the top left corner, followed by an italisised player name and position. The bottom border is where we find a colour matched team name with thin black pinstripes 
running left to right, terminating in the NHL's 75th Anniversary logo. Subset cards were exactly the same save for the bottom border, which was usually replaced with subset-specific graphics,
like the <i>Young Guns</i> logo or international team crests. Speaking of subsets, there were plenty - the set kicks off with a 5-card all-Russian <i>Super Series</i> set, followed by the ever popular Canada Cup subset. Over the course of both series, we 
are treated to an additional six subsets: <i>1991 Daft Choice</i> & <i>Star Rookie</i> in the Low Series, and another <i>Canada Cup</i>, <i>Young Guns</i>, <i>All Star</i> and <i>World Junior Championship</i> in the High Series. 
<p>
And speaking of Low and High Series, eagle-eyed collectors (and eBay shoppers) will have noticed two version of the famous Upper Deck anti-counterfeit hologram - one consisting of the words "UPPER DECK", the other with the Upper Deck diamond logo. 
So what gives? Well, remember there was effective two print runs - the original print run of Low Series cards (1-500) all had the "UPPER DECK" style logo. But when the High Series cards (501-700) were printed Upper Deck changed the hologram design to the diamond.
 Recall that High Series packs also contained Low Series cards - and so the low cards from High Series packs also got the new version of the logo. So if you come across a low card with a diamond holo, it came from a High Series pack. Mystery solved...
</p>
<p>
As for rookies, they really are spread out across the entire 700-card set, not just confined to the <i>Young Guns</i> subset.  And what a rookie class it was - 173 in total including Vladimir Malakhov, 	Teemu Selanne, Nicklas Lidstrom (with his first name spelled <i>Niklas</i>), Peter Forsberg, Valeri Kamensky, 
Dominik Hasek, John LeClair, Doug Weight, Tony Amonte, Adam Foote, Alexei Yashin, Nikolai Khabibulin, Alexei Kovalev, Sergei Zholtok, and Sandis Ozolinsh. It's a huge group of star players, but really the only 
card today commanding any decent value in a PSA 10 is the Selanne card, and maybe the Forsberg, Lidstrom and Hasek. And that's unfortunate, because Upper Deck's tendency to print <i>a lot</i> of cards has made this set seem like a 
waste of time from an investment perspective. My advice? Buy Apple stock and watch it grow, and for significantly less than the cost of a single share of my favourite tech company you can own the <i>entire set</i>. And all the subsets. And still have some money left over for gas.

As an interesting side note, Upper Deck plastered a few billboards along the main highways in Montreal that year with a picture of Patrick Roy's card and the words "ÃŠchange Roy" (Trade Roy) above the card in big black letters. People lost their minds! 
Obviously the billboard was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the hobby itself and the fundamental aspect of trading cards with your friends. Pure marketing genius.
