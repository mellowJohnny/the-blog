McHockey! The 1991-92 Upper Deck McDonald's set was the first of a nearly 20 year run of McDonald's hockey sets produced exclusively for sale in Canada. 
Early sets were relatively small, and given McDonald's NHL All-Star Game sponsorship, it made perfect sense that they featured players who had been selected for the NHL "All-Star" game. 
And while Upper Deck was not always the partner of choice (Pinnacle and Pacific also made a few sets) they produced more of the sets than any other manufacturer. 
Unfortunately that annual tradition ended with the 2009-10 season, the last year Upper Deck and McDonald's collaborated on a set. There was no 2010-11 set, but there was one final set - a one-off Montreal Canadiens Upper Deck set in 2011-12. Luckily for Canadian hockey fans Tim Hortons picked up the mantle in 2014-15 - a tradition which (as of 2022) continued to this day.

<p>on to the set review...</p>
<p>
It was a minimalist set of 24 player cards, one checklist / header card, and some pretty awesome hologram sticker inserts. Packs at the time sold for $0.99 with the purchase of fries or a Coke if I remember, three cards per pack. Holograms were inserted randomly. So with just 24 cards, it did not take too long to build a set. And of course packs turned up (entire boxes actually) at local card shows - many McFranchisees also took advantage of the promo and back-doored boxes to dealers.

The set size was interesting - 24 cards does not cover each and every player given the nod, (a total of 42  players were named) the folks at Upper Deck obviously decided 24 cards was "big enough" and cherry-picked the best.  The set was issued to celebrate the 43rd NHL All Star Game 
in Philadelphia that year, the action shots themselves were all from the previous year's game, which took place at Chicago Stadium on January 19, 1991. First-time All-Stars cards a static shots in the same jersey, while for some reason Cam Neely's card has him in an away Bruins jersey.

	The set itself was divided by Conference, with 12 
players from the Wales Conference and 12 players from the Campbell Conference - for those keeping score at home, Campbell won the game 10-6. THe 6 holograms were the cream of the crop that year - Gretzky, 
Chelios, Bourque, Hull, Neely, and Roy. The bilingual cards themselves were pretty standard for Upper Deck at the time - clean white borders, player name and position and the McDonald's All-Star logo with red lines 
running along the bottom and right side of the card. Cards backs were also pretty standard for Upper Deck at the time - 2nd picture plus an All-Star related blurb. My favourite touch though is the use of McDonald's "M" logo for the standard Upper Deck anti-counterfeit hologram.

But the real standout for me at least is the holograms. After a bit of a false-start with the '90-'91 inserts in the main set, Upper Deck really got a handle on the tech of the day and produced some pretty decent holograms. The five 
holos included in this set - especially the Patrick Roy - are really pretty good.  And they would have been even better had they also been cards and not stickers. But they still rock.

    catch them in the right light and these are some good-lookin' holos...</p>

Overall the set is just OK - in some ways it's a nice record of who made the All Star team that year, but on the other hand it's super one-dimensional. No rookies (and after Crosby was included in the 2006 set 
there was much debate about whether a true rookie can be in a "regional" set), no sub-sets, just All Stars. Interestingly the set's value has held up fairly well over the years (around $20-ish lately on eBay), and there certainly 
are non-sports collectors who seek out any McDonald's related promo merch. But unless you are an Upper Deck completist or a McDonald's collector, I'd only pick one up if I found it for a song.
