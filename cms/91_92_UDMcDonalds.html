The 1991-92 Upper Deck McDonald's set was the first of a nearly 20 year run of McDonald's hockey sets produced exclusively for sale in Canada. 
Most sets were relatively small, and given McDonald's NHL All-Star Game sponsorship, made perfect sense that they followed an "All-Star" format. 
And while Upper Deck was not always the partner of choice (Pinnacle and Pacific also made a few sets) they produced more of the sets than any other manufacturer. 
Sadly the traditional annual McDonald's hockey set ended with the last set produced for the 2009-10 season. 
There was no 2010-11 set produced in Canada, then a final a one-off Montreal Canadiens Upper Deck set in 2011-12, after which Tim Hortons picked up the mantle - a tradition which (as of 2022) continues to this day.

<p>on to the set review...</p>

It was a simple affair, 24 player cards, one checklist, and some pretty awesome hologram sticker inserts. Although the cards were in celebration of the 43rd All Star Game 
in Philadelphia that year, the player shots were taken the year before during the previous season's game, which took place in Chicago Stadium on January 19, 1991. The set itself was divided by Conference, with 12 
players from the Wales Conference and 12 players from the Campbell Conference - for those keeping score at home, Campbell won the game 10-6. THe 6 holograms were the cream of the crop that year - Gretzky, 
Chelios, Bourque, Hull, Neely, and Roy. The bilingual cards themselves were pretty standard for Upper Deck at the time - clean white borders, player name and position and the McDonald's All-Star logo with red lines 
running along the bottom and right side of the card. Cards backs were also pretty standard for Upper Deck at the time - 2nd picture plus stats.

But the real standout for me at least is the holograms. After a bit of a false-start with the '90-'91 inserts in the main set, Upper Deck really got a handle on the tech of the day and produced some pretty decent holograms. The five 
holos included in this set - especially the Patrick Roy - are really pretty good.  And they would have been even better had they also been cards and not stickers. But they still rock.

Overall the set is just OK - in some ways it's a nice record of who made the All Star team that year, but on the other hand it's super one-dimensional. No rookies (and after Crosby was included in the 2006 set 
there has been some debate about whether a true rookie can be in a "regional" set), no sub-sets, just All Stars. Interestingly the set's value has held up fairly well over the years (around $20-ish lately on eBay), and there certainly 
are non-sports collectors who seek out any McDonald's related promo merch. But unless you are an Upper Deck completist or a McDonald's collector, I'd only pick one up if I found it for a song.
