    If there's one thing you can count on in the business world it's capitalizing on past success.  Hollywood is masterful at 
    producing sequels for just about any movie that does well, and O-Pee-Chee was different in 1991-92 when they release the follow-up 
    the wildly successful Premier set from the season before.
