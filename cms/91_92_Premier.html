    If there's one thing you can count on in the business world it's attempting to capitalise on past success.  Hollywood is masterful at 
    producing sequels for just about any movie that does well, and O-Pee-Chee was no different in 1991-92 with the release the follow-up 
    the wildly successful Premier set from the season before. If you recall, the inaugural set was a premium 132-card affair, limited-ish, 
    and most importantly loaded with rookies.  Unfortunately the '91-'92 was none of those things except premium.  The set had grown to 198 cards 
    and the biggest star rookie in the set was Nicklas Lidstrom.  Other than minor stars Tony Amonte and Doug Weight that was about it for rookies. 
    So to recap...the set was bigger than the year before, OPC printed a shit-ton of it based on the popularity of the '90-'91 Premier set, and Lidstom 
    was the only rookie worth talking about.  Awesome.</p>

    Which is all kind of a shame actually, because OPC managed to put together a really nice set despite it's lack of collectability.

	<strong>On to the set review...</strong>

    This was again OPC's premium offering, and as such continued with crisp white high-quality card stock, a similar design to the previous set 
    with a gold header displaying the OPC & Premier band logos, team colour coordinated side bars, and a nice big, shouty all-caps font at the foot of 
    the card for the player name along with an almost microscopic team name and position.  All-in-all though it left a lot of room for the player shots, which 
    continued to get more creative.  No doubt Upper Deck's photography forced everyone to step up their photography game, which benefitted us all. 
    Card backs again featured a player head-shot, some condensed stats, a massive team logo, and a huge "1992 Premier" graphic 
    running up the right side. The set was again organised in the now universally accepted random player selection format.  In addition to having 66 more cards 
    in the set, O-Pee-Chee also broke from last year's set by including an "Original Six" subset, sprinkled throughout the final 64 cards.

    The NHL celebrated it's 75th anniversary during the 1991-92 season and each of the Original Six teams (Montreal, Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and Detroit) contributed  
    with some pretty decent throw-back jerseys.  Detroit brought back the red stripes from their 1928 unis, Boston rocked a jersey design from 1933, Chicago, the Leafs and the Rangers 
    brought back their 1940 jerseys, and Montreal paid tribute with a jersey design from 1926.  Which was lame, because if you are a hard-core NHL fan you'll 
    know the Habs jersey has largely stayed the same for 100+ years.  So why not bring back some of Montreal's truly different jerseys like 1945-46?  Or the "barber pole" jersey from 
    the 1912-13 season?  Missed opportunity. Anyway, the subset contained 6 extra cards for each team (a total of 36 cards for those of you who suck at math) showcasing a current player 
    in the throwback jersey. Cards chronicled each team's history - a card with the history of the team name, draft choices, the all-time stats for goals & assists, as well as Stanley Cup championships and 
    banners.  It also gave us essentially two Lidstrom rookies cards depending on how you are scoring at home - his regular player card as well as an Original 6 cards featuring Detroit's banners.
    This was also the first year we got to see the newly-minted San Jose Sharks team appear in a set - in fact OPC wasted no time, putting Doug Wilson in the set at card #6
