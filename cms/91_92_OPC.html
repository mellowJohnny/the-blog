    Wow.  Where to start with this train wreck of a set.  Crappy card design? Check.  Massive set size? Check. Notable rookies? 
    None to speak of. Atrocious card quality?  Unless you like off-centered cards, double check. Am I done with annoying rhetorical 
    questions? No. In all seriousness though, this really was not O-Pee-Chee's best effort.  The biggest rookie in the set is John LeClair - 
    now clearly OPC can't control a particular year's rookie class, but there is no Nicklas Lidstrom. I guess 528 cards was just not big enough to 
    include him.  And the sheer number of off-centered cards made me think this was the '81-'82 set.  It's unfathomable that OPC was able to 
    produce two quality O-Pee-Chee Premier sets but shit the bed with this set.  I even pulled a creased card out of a factory set. Yes,
    in 1992 OPC was still producing the occasional card with a crease straight from the factory.

	<strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This was the second year in a row in which O-Pee-Chee released a ginormous card set - 528 plus a 66-card insert set, for a total of 
    594 cards.  If this wasn't bad enough, the card design was about the worst I've seen. Honestly two small fixes would have helped enormously - 
    get rid of the series of thin black lines running across the bottom border, and reduce the side borders to a single thin line.  Overall 
    it's just a really busy vibe. In contrast to previous seasons when the colour scheme usually tried to mirror the represented team's colours, 
    for some reason the border colours seem oddly random - brown and green on the Blackhawks cards, gray and red on the Jets cards...but matching 
    dark green and black on the Stars cards. Go figure.   
<p>
    Contrast this with the great job OPC did with the Premier sets, and it's a bit of a head-scratcher. Until you realise...OPC didn't design the cards - Topps did. 
    In fact O-Pee-Chee just printed and marketed the cards - they simply licensed the sets, changed the logo, made minor variations like increasing the set size 
    (for the hockey crazy Canadians) to feature more Canadian teams etc.  So this one's on Topps.

    Same for the photography - after the gorgeous job Upper Deck did anything less is really obvious - and most of the 
    shots in this set are just too dark.  There were some more playful shots like Shane Corson blowing bubble gum or Glenn Healy, mask up, blocker off, 
    leaning on the crossbar.  Fun shots. But there just was not enough of it. The back, oddly enough, looked great. Standard old-school full stats, 
    no secondary picture, and a great blue & white main section with red and yellow highlights. And that cool skate!  A nod to the '79-'80 set maybe?  Awesome.

    But when you add up the massive quantities printed, massive set size, dismal cut quality, lack of star power and poor-ish photography, it's really forgettable. 
    When the back of the cards are the best feature, we got problems.  So....should you have a set?  Only if you are an O-Pee-Chee completist.  But do yourself 
    a favour and buy a factory set and leave sealed. You will only be disappointed if you open it and actually look at the cards.
