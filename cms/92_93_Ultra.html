When the 1992-93 Fleer Ultra set hit the market in the Fall of 1992, it blew the doors off most of everything that has been released to date.
Full-bleed, high-gloss, gold foil-stamped - high-quality all around. And expensive. I can't recall what retail was at the time for a pack, but I do remember thinking it was 
a bit outrageous. But those cards! Stunning. This was <i>the</i> premium set of the '92-'93 season.
</p>
<p>on to the set review...</p>
<p>
Fleer's first ultra-premium hockey set was divided into two series - a 250-card Series 1 and a 200-card "rookie & updates" Series 2, for a total of 
450 cards. Still a bit on the hefty side, but not as bad as Upper Deck. And with 14 cards to a pack, it wasn't too steep of a climb to put a set together. The card design is stunning - 
high-gloss full-bleed photos with minimal graphics was an attempt to let the photography do the talking. And the graphic design was great - and angled blue ice slash at the bottom
 with colour-coordinated player name and team banners. And judicious use of golf foil on the Fleer logo and blue "ice" slash made the cards feel super-premium. Almost Ultra you 
 might say. Cards backs were equally well thought-out with two more close-cropped player shots (an action shot and a head shot) overlayed on a hockey rink graphic. The rink graphic 
 was also a team colour-coordinated fade, along with team logo, bio, and super-minimal stats. To be honest the back of the cards were better than some set's card fronts - they were that good.

But my favourite part of the set was the old-skool organization of the set - alphabetically by team. I've said it before: to me a set of hockey cards is a time capsule, it's recorded history 
and organising the set by teams is a great way to see who was on the team that year. Take the 1981-82 OPC set for example and look at the Oilers cards: 3rd year Gretzky, Lowe rookie, Kurri rookie, 
Moog rookie, Messier 2nd year, it's just amazing to see the players on that powerhouse team all together. But where this set falls down from my nostalgic pedistal is the lack of subsets. There are none.
Rookie cards are called out with a nice gold leaf banner, but that's a stretch. So we have no idea which players hit milestones, which players made the All-Star Team last season, who won the season's awards...
. And my last complaint is with some of the photography - the shots are generally great, but the occasional card suffers from underexposure. In many cases the ice either look gray or really blue.

Speaking of inserts, there were plenty, this was the early '90s after all. In Series I we had four in total - a 12-card <i>NHL All-Stars</i> set, a ten-card <i>Award Winners</i> set, 
an 8-card <i>Ultra Rookies</i> set, and finally a 12-card <i>Performance Highlights</i> set. Which explains why the main set had no subsets - they were move to inserts. The <i>Performance Highlights</i> set featured Jeremy Roenick exclusively, as 
he was a big deal at the time. Not super collectible now, but Roenick was hot back then. An only the first ten were inserted into packs, the other two were only available as a main-in. Boo. In Series 2 we had just one 
massive insert set to collect - a 25-card <i>Ultra Imports</i> set.

Lastly, how 'bout them rookies? how about 43 in total? That's roughly 10% of the total set. Not too bad. And I think Fleer did a pretty good job - Bill Guerin is probably the biggest star, but we also had Roman Hamerlik, Dmitri Yuskevitch, 
Tommy Soderstrom, Richard Smehlik, Sergei Zubov, Martin Straka, Andrei Kovalenko, Igor Korolev, Rob Zamuner and Steve Konowalchuk. 
</p>
<p>
    So, what's the bottom line? It's a beautiful set, but worth next to nothing today unfortunately. Which is actually good news for those of you who do not already have a set - it's truely worth having, and can be had for a song.
