    Score did not sit out the rush to "Premium" sets for the 1991-'92 season, launching the inaugural Pinnacle set with a 420
    card offering. And just like the main-line Score sets, it was available in two languages - an "American" set in English, and a "Canadian" set in French.  
    And not to be outdone by the cool anti-piracy holograms introduced by Upper Deck, Score came to market with their own anti-piracy "grid" 
    at the bottom of each card back.  But it was a bit lane to be honest, as a special plastic "reader" was needed to verify authenticity.  
    I never got one.  Not even sure how one went about acquiring one to be honest. Dealers had them, but what's the point if you need to 
    visit a dealer to check a card?  Anyway, the holograms were a better solution, but hey, it created a bit of buzz.

    This most striking aspect of the new set was the design - not only did cards fronts feature two players pictures (a headshot and an action shot), 
    but the cards were black.  Like other than a small white border, almost entirely black.  I still find it jarring.  And two pictures on 
    the front of the card made it feel like you were looking at the back of the card.  Weird.  This to me is another example of card companies 
    dealing with a completely saturated market, looking for any possible edge or gimmick to stand out from the crowd.

	<strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>

    So...new set in a crowded market, with a gimmicky design.  But it wasn't all bad.  Hell, the set kicked off with Super Mario 
    at card #1, so bang!  Let's get goin'! As was standard at the time, player cards were not organised in any particular order. So yeah, 
    the  cards were essentially black, with an all-caps colour-coordinated team name at the top and a screaming yellow all-caps player name 
    and position at the bottom.  The footer contained a small white Pinnacle logo and a final colour-coordinated bar at the bottom, all surrounded 
    by a crisp white border. Card stock was top-quality - nice & thick. Flip the card over and we get the player name and card number at the top, 
    Team logo was right below, and some old-skool name, rank, and serial number stats (height, weight, age, etc) then a little player bio. 
    Only at the very bottom of the card do we see the war on stats continue, with just a single line dedicated to chronicling the player's '90-'91 campaign. 
    My favourite part of the card back was the close-cropped player action shot set against a black background. Genius.  
</p>
<p>
    Packs contained 12 cards each (I also seem to recall Jumbo packs), but at a total of 420 cards (and a ridiculous amount of doubles) putting a set 
    together was a chore.  No factory sets either. I think I bought a hand-collated set from a card shop. There was a single random 12-card <i>Team Pinnacle</i> 
    insert set containing what came to be known as the "B Cards" due to their numbering B1 through B12. The cards themselves were a bit dull - in keeping with the 
    black theme, the cards featured black & white portrait shots of the stars of the day.  Yawn. But the Rookie crop was decent - basically every set had Nicklas Lidstrom, 
    Tony Amonte, Doug Weight, John LeClair, Adam Foote, and Scott Niedermayer.  To be honest the rookies in the Pinnacle set were pretty good, but unfortunately 
    due to massive quantities produced are not worth too much these days.

    Oh, did somebody say they wanted subsets? Oh, we got yer subsets, baby!  In fact, 113 of the final 120 cards are divided between six subsets. 
    Let's start with a 55-card, sequentially numbered <i>Rookies</i> set featuring rookies & sophomores on a green background rather than black, 
    with just a single headshot on the back, plus player bio. Immediately following the Rookies was the <i>Gamewinners</i> set.  Then oddly we get 
    another 5 player cards (featuring Eric Lindros in his Team Canada colours) before we are treated to the creepiest subset of all time.

    Some genius at Score commissioned a child (I'm guessing) to paint 10 portraits of players wearing tuxedos for their <i>Good Guys</i> subset. 
    Mind blowing. After exiting hell, we get two pretty cool ones - the <i>Technicians</i> and <i>The Idols</i> subsets. 
    And last but not least, the idea the intern came up with - <i>Pro Sideline</i>. I get the concept - show us what the boys like to do in the 
    off-season - but man, who designed these cards?   Bagels on the top and Pat Flatley on the bottom? A chicken and Link Gaetz?  Wow.  Just...wow.  
    And then in a moment of panic the production manager realised they forgot Don Sweeney and Mark Hardy and squeezed them in as the final two cards.  Bizarre.

    Although the black theme is initially a bit jarring, the set is ironically quite colourful - the combination of team colour scheme elements,
    bright yellow player names, and decent photography actually make the set pop, especially the close-cropped action shot on the back.
    Of the first two "all black" Pinnacle sets, I think I like this one the best.  The set size is not obnoxious, player selection is good, the Rookies 
    subset is pretty strong, and it's actually nice to look at.  Again, full hand-collated sets can be found pretty cheaply, and even the Team 
    Pinnacle inserts are reasonably priced now.  What's not to like?
