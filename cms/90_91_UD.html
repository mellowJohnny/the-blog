    The set the hobby had been waiting for...
</p>
<p>
    Upper Deck's contribution to the sports card collecting hobby had been well documented by the time their first hockey set rolled
    around for the 1990-91 season.  Excellent quality in both card stock and cutting, top-shelf photography, and ground-breaking, 
    creative sub-sets like the now legendary <i>Young Guns</i> subset, which for the first time grouped the season's hottest 
    prospects into a single subset. With a massive 550-card set size spread across a "Low" and "High" series and a loaded rookie 
    checklist (even sneaking Eric Lindros in via the World Junior Championship subset even though he was signed exclusively to Score) 
    this was the definitive set of the season. Packs also eschewed tradition by ditching wax & gum (and the card-ruining stains that 
    ruined at least one card per pack) and focused on providing top-quality cards safely packed in a paper-foil hybrid flow-pack.  
<p>
    And how 'bout them rookies - Jagr, Fedorov,  Roenick, Bure, Modano, Belfour (a notable OPC miss) and Joseph.  
    And an amazing group of secondary RCs almost too many to mention: Kevin Stevens, Alexander Mogilny, Mike Richter, Rob Blake, 
    the legendary soviet stars Viacheslav Fetisov & Alexei Kasatonov, Mark Recchi, Petr Nedved, Mats Sundin, Felix Potvin, Peter Bondra
     - and the Central Red Army's famed KLM Line: Vladimir Krutov, Igor Larionov & Sergei Makarov.  Due to the Fall release date, 
     Upper Deck did need to feature some of their key rookie cards with "draft day" shots like the Jagr RC or national team jerseys 
     like Bure's Young Guns card, which is no longer the case.

    <strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The stand-out feature of the set though was the photography.  For the first time it seemed like a heavy emphasis was put on capturing
    players in dynamic game situations, or with unique perspectives like Messier holding the Cup, the use of a fish-eye lens on Larry 
    Robinson's card, the over-head shot of a Mario Gosselin save, Ray Bourque hopping over the boards or Rick Tabaracci laying a check.  
    All this in stark contrast to O-Pee-Chee's usual assortment of players during warm-up. It was refreshing.  And even if they perhaps 
    over-did the digital colour saturation, it was fresh and was miles ahead on what O-Pee-Chee or (anyone else for that matter) was doing. 
    And while it wasn't all perfect - I could do without the weird-looking Team Card paintings - overall the set gorgeous.
</p>
<p>
    And let's talk about the sub-sets - no less than seven total including the usual Award Winners and All-Stars, but also creative collections such 
    as the World Juniors Champions, a nod to history with NHL Heroes, the now-famous Young Guns, and Star Rookies sprinkled throughout the set.
</p>

    Card design was pretty good - I was not a big fan of the marbled look on the colour-keyed bottom and right-side border, but over time 
    I've come to accept it.  Top of the card is where we find the player name & position, while the bottom is reserved for the team name & logo.  
    It is also where you'll find my one sticking point with Upper Deck cards.  At the time, I was a little annoyed that a massive US company,
    famous for making <i>baseball</i> cards, was entering my sacred hockey card market in Canada.  The fact that their logo is essentially a baseball 
    diamond (on a hockey card!) did not help.  It took me a while to get over it.  The back of the cards also began the new tradition of focusing 
    on the players by including another photo, with less of a focus on stats.  No full career stats here kids.  Not even a player bio or fun-fact. 
    Was this progress?  At what cost?  No full stats?  What's the point of a hockey card then!  Eventually I got over that too.  But as a purist this 
    was a lot to take in.  Gimme a minute.
</p>
<p>
    But I think was disappointed me the most was the release of the 200-card "High" series.  Packs were a <i>mix</i> of "Low" and "High" cards!  Is this 
    some kind of mistake?  A joke perhaps? No, no it wasn't.  In fact it was a well calculated marketing move to make it even more difficult to complete the 
    High series set.  But hey, if you didn't like it you could always buy the High Series Factory Set.  In hind sight it was The Beginning of The End.  Hockey card sets 
    were no longer a way to sell more gum - they were now the product, and the product was aimed squarely at Collectors.  Not kids in the arena buying 
    Bazooka, a blueberry Slush Puppy and a few packs of mis-cut, wax-stained cardboard.  Not kids at the corner store spending their snow shovelling money.
    Nope, even the packs themselves proudly stated Upper Deck cards were <i>The Collectors' Choice</i>.  And with that, cards had hit the big time.
</p>
<p>
    The age of quaint, childhood innocence embodied by collecting cardboard heroes was gone, and the Junk Wax Era had begun in earnest.
</p>
<p>
    But it wasn't all bad - yes, the Upper Deck marketing machine was in full swing, but we did get a remarkable set with a lot of Firsts.  Arguably 
    this was the first premium hockey card set to hit the market, the first to focus squarely on the photography, the first to recognize and focus on Rookies, 
    to expand the definition of what a sub-set could be, and began experimenting with new technologies for inserts with the first hologram insert set.  
    It wasn't perfect - no names, no card numbers just a blurry guess of who was on the card / sticker, but it was a start.
