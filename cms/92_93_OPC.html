	The 1992-93 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary O-Pee-Chee set was <i>the</i> very last O-Pee-Chee set printed in Canada. The end of an era. But hang on - surely OPC had been producing hockey cards for more than 25 years, right? Yes they had. The 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary set was in celebration of a 25 year licensing partnership between The Topps Company of Brooklyn, NY, and the O-Pee-Chee Company of London, Ontario. A bit of history. O-Pee-Chee produced their first hockey cards in 1934, but it wasn't until the 1968-69 season that Topps and O-Pee-Chee officially hooked-up and began producing the two seasonal hockey sets that defined hockey card collecting for 25 years - Topps in the US and O-Pee-Chee in Canada. Traditionally the sets were almost identical - the Topps sets were usually released in the Fall, were a bit smaller, and printed with English text. The OPC sets were normally released in the Winter, contained more cards, usually a few variations and had bilingual text. So the 1992-93 season marked 25 years of that licensing partnership, and this set was released to celebrate it.

What makes this set special is not it's rarity or invetment-quality rookie class or it's premium quality - it is none of those things. What makes it special is this is the last one. The last truly "Canadian" hockey card set - conceived, designed, and printed in London, Ontario.
