The 1992-93 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary O-Pee-Chee set was <i>the</i> very last O-Pee-Chee set printed in Canada. The end of an era. But hang on - surely OPC had been producing hockey cards for more than 25 years, right? Yes they had. The 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary set was in celebration of a 25 year licensing partnership between The Topps Company of Brooklyn, NY, and the O-Pee-Chee Company of London, Ontario.

First, a bit of history. O-Pee-Chee produced their first hockey cards in 1934, but it wasn't until the 1968-69 season that Topps and O-Pee-Chee officially hooked-up and began producing the two seasonal hockey sets that defined hockey card collecting for 25 years: the US Topps set and the Canadian O-Pee-Chee set. Traditionally the two sets were nearly identical - the Topps sets were usually released in the Fall, were a bit smaller, and printed with English text. The OPC sets were normally released in the Winter, contained more cards, usually a few variations (they had time to update cards of players who had been traded over the Summer) and had bilingual text. So the 1992-93 season marked 25 years of that licensing partnership, and this set was released to celebrate it.

A few things made this set special. First, it was one of the rare OPC sets which differed <i>completely</i> from the Topps set, it was the <i>last</i> OPC to to be printed in Canada, and it had a super cool insert set which reprinted some of the most iconic OPC rookie cards from the previous 25 seasons. We're talkin' Bobby Clarke, Marcel Dionne (instead of Lafleur??) Wayne Gretzky, Mike Bossy, Paul Coffey, Mark Messier, Grant Fuhr, Mario Lemieux, Patrick Roy. Given few of us are lucky enough to own a Gretzky RC, or even a Lemieux, this was a pretty good way to have one. Interestingly a Phil Esposito card from the '77-'78 set is included, yet his rookie was in the 1965-66 set, and the OPC Premier Pavel Bure is not a true RC, but then again OPC missed the boat on Bure in the '90-'91 set. Ouch.

    on to the set review...
</p>
<p>
First of all, this set is like night and day compare with the previous two year's releases - super clean card design, semi premium card stock, anf for the most part solid photography. What stands out the most to me is the design. A single metallic steely-blue stripe running the left side of the card with a repeating O-Pee-Chee logo, and a medium gray banner at the foot of the card to hold the player name, team, and position. The rest is all action. And the back is awesome. How can the back be awesome when it's not the front of the card you ask? Because it's a classic hockey card back - full stats, player bio, and a team logo. Wonderful, it's how it should be. And we have checklists - interestingly they are organised by team, yet the card set it not. I've seen "Team Checklists", but not the set checklist organised by team.
</p>
<p>
As for subsets, there are two commemorative cards - one for Mario Lemieux's MVP Award and a card for Mike Gartner's 500<sup>th</sup> goal - but the real star of the show is the rookie redux cards.  OPC took the same 25 players from the reprint insert set and included them in the regular set with the original card design, but a <i>new</i> picture. Ever wonder what Brett Hull's RC would have looked like if it wasn't an airbrushed Calgary Flames headshot? Or if Joe Sakic didn't look so angry? Or a Lemieux card with almost a smile? In some ways it's a bit jarring to see such iconic cards *especially Gretzky) with a new pictures, but in other ways it's pure genius. And really only something OPC can pull off - these are their historical card designs and images. It's fantastic.
</p>
<p>
And let's not forget this was also the very last time O-Pee-Chee cards came to us wrapped in wax paper, 8 cards per pack, with one reprint insert. There was no gum, but it was nice to see that OPC never switched to flow packs for their main set - wax until the end, baby. And yes, some of the cards in my set have wax stains, just like it should be. And the set was 396 cards - not 440, not 525, not 700. 396. Like it should be. There were also two versions of the factory set - a 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary edition which included the insert set and came fancy-ish box, and a regular factory set.s

Overall I love this set - the fact that O-Pee-Chee got their sh*t together for their final set put a smile on my face. Nothing like going out with a bang. The set may not be worth much (although graded Gretzky reprints can fetch top dollar) but the purist in me doesn't care. I collect what I like, not what I think will be worth something down the road. And that makes this set a must have. Even if it's just for nostalgia's sake.
