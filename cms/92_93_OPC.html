The 1992-93 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary O-Pee-Chee set was <i>the</i> very last O-Pee-Chee set printed in Canada. The end of an era. The name of this set was a bit confusing for some, becasue clearly
OPC had been producing hockey set for more than 25 years. True. What this set was celebrating was the 25th Anniversary of the licensing partnership 
between The Topps Company of Brooklyn, NY, and the O-Pee-Chee Company of London, Ontario, Canad. A bit of history. O-Pee-Chee.
