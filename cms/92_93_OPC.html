The 1992-93 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary O-Pee-Chee set was <i>the</i> very last O-Pee-Chee set printed in Canada. The end of an era. 
Many were confused by the name though, thinking that perhaps OPC had only been producing hockey cards for 25 years. That of course is not 
the case, as O-Pee-Chee's very first hockey set was produced back in 1934, and later in the post-war era. But it wasn't until the 1968-69 
season that Topps and O-Pee-Chee officially hooked-up and began producing the two seasonal hockey sets that defined hockey card collecting 
for 25 years - Topps in the US and O-Pee-Chee in Canada. Traditionally the sets were almost identical - the Topps sets were usually released in the Fall, 
were a bit smaller, and printed with English text. The OPC sets were normally released in the Winter, contained more cards, usually a few variations 
and had bilingual text. So the 1992-93 season marked 25 years of that licensing partnership, and this set was released to celebrate it.

What makes this set special is not it's rarity or invetment-quality rookie class or it's premium quality - it is none of those things. 
What makes it special is this is the last one. The last truly "Canadian" hockey card set - conceived, designed, and printed in London, Ontario.
