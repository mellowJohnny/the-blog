The 1992-93 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary O-Pee-Chee set was <i>the</i> very last O-Pee-Chee set printed in Canada. The end of an era. But hang on - surely OPC had been producing hockey cards for more than 25 years, right? Yes they had. The 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary set was in celebration of a 25 year licensing partnership between The Topps Company of Brooklyn, NY, and the O-Pee-Chee Company of London, Ontario.

First, a bit of history. O-Pee-Chee produced their first hockey cards in 1934, but it wasn't until the 1968-69 season that Topps and O-Pee-Chee officially hooked-up and began producing the two seasonal hockey sets that defined hockey card collecting for 25 years: the US Topps set and the Canadian O-Pee-Chee set. Traditionally the two sets were nearly identical - the Topps sets were usually released in the Fall, were a bit smaller, and printed with English text. The OPC sets were normally released in the Winter, contained more cards, usually a few variations (they had time to update cards of players who had been traded over the Summer) and had bilingual text. So the 1992-93 season marked 25 years of that licensing partnership, and this set was released to celebrate it.

A few things made this set special. First, it was one of the rare OPC sets which differed <i>completely</i> from the Topps set, it was the <i>last</i> OPC to to be printed in Canada, and it had a super cool insert set which reprinted some of the most iconic OPC rookies cards from the previous 25 seasons. We're talkin' Bobby Clarke, Marcel Dionne (instead of Dryden or Lafleur??) Wayne Gretzky, Mike Bossy, Paul Coffey, Mark Messier, Grant Fuhr, Mario Lemieux, Patrick Roy. Given few of us are lucky enough to own a Gretzky RC, this was a pretty good way to have one. And it was all wrapped in a tradional, old school wax wrapper. No gum though.
