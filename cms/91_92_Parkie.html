The 1951-52 Parkhurst set is the grandaddy of them all - widely considered to be the set that ushered in the "modern" era of hockey cards. Coming in at a healthy 105 cards covering the Oiginal Six teams, the set is essentially all rookie cards, and features the rookies of none other than <i>Mr. Hockey</i> Gordie Howe, and Maurice <i>The Rocket</i> Richard. It is <i>the</i> hockey card set. Fast forward exactly 40 years to the 1991-92 release of a completely modern Parkhurst set, manufactured by Pro Set. 
Resurrecting such a venerable name was both bold and risky at the same time. Do it wrong and the Hockey Gods will punish you severely. Get it right and you look like a genius. So did Pro Set get it right?

I was quite excited about this set when it was first released, so much so that I ignored the fact that it was nothing more than Pro Set's "me-too" premium offering. But at the time it was pretty cool - the resurrection of the venerable Parkhurst marque, nice premium card stock, and a high-gloss finish. Very cool at the time. Ultimately though this set turned out to be more of the same from Pro Set - better card quality, but mediocre photography and huge print runs.

on to the set review...
</p>
<p>
This set was was a throwback to sets of yesteryear, a time when most sets were organised alphabetically by team. Given the Parkie set was new-skool retro, it's no surprise that Pro Set took some cues from those classic Parkie sets from the late 1950's / early 60s and did exactly the same thing, organising the players alphabetically by Team. Which I liked a lot, especially since just about all other sets that year were the standard random assortment of players.  It immediately felt a bit retro. The set was divided into two 225-card series for a total of 450 cards, plus a final 25 card <i>Final Update</i> only available via mail-order. And good luck finding the set cheap, today it's the only valuable piece of the set. And similar to Upper Deck, instead of releasing a bilingual set, Pro Set made a French set available exclusively in Canada. Also not worth much today either :-).
<p>
The set may have had a retro feel to it, but the card design was anything but, with a large bronzy looking marble tragedy down the left hand side to hold a vertical player name, a teal Parkhust logo bottom left, and the rest of the real estate left for the player shot. Which normally would have worked super-well if the player shots were any good. In typical Pro Set style, most looked under-exposed, with bizarre cropping decisions which more often than not chopped off too much of the actual player. Maybe they were trying to be artsy, or make the action look super-close up, but it missed the mark. Again, compare the action directly to the Upper Deck set of the same year and it's like night and day.

Card stock was excellent though, and the high-gloss finish was pretty cool. The card backs continued the bronzy-brown theme and included a small player head shot and...wait for it...full player stats! I'm going to assume again that given the retro-inspired vibe they were going for, complete player stats - standard in the <i>old days</i> - were a must. Plus a player bio. Which just goes to show you that if you study hard, try your best and give 110%, you really can have it all. One footnote on the high-gloss finish. Fast forward 30-ish years and combine that awesome glossy coating with exactly the wrong environmental conditions and you end up with a solid brick of fused cards. Like I did. It was not just Pro Set tho - I've had the same issues with the Fleer Ultra sets, the Leaf sets, all those fancy glossy jobs.  Luckily the same did not happen if you stored the cards in UltraPro protective pages.

What else...what else...lemme think...oh yeah, Rookies and Sub-sets! There was no dedicated sub-set for rookies, but each was called out with a little teal shield in the top right corner with the word "rookie", so as not to miss the potential investment opportunity. And speaking of rookies, there is actually a very solid crop represented in the set - Nicklas Lidstrom, Vladimir Konstantinov, Geoff Sanderson, John LeClair, Tony Amonte, Doug Weight, Joé Juneau, Dominik Hasek, Slava Kozlov, Valeri Kamensky, Adam Foote, and Keith Tkachuk. And if you managed to order the Update Set, Bill Guerin. So maybe not quite as extensive as the rookie class in the Upper Deck set, but 74 is excellent. Come to think of it, I'm not sure the Guerrin card is officially considered a Rookie, since it was part of the mail-away Update set. 
</p>
<p>Back to the sub-sets. They all appear at the tail end of each series, and are similar in design. Series 1 contains the <i>1,000 Point Club</i>, <i>League Leader</i>, and <i>Frequent All Star</i> cards. Continuing with the retro feel, the All Star subset was clearly designed with a nod to the late '50s / early '60s Parkie sets, with a close-cropped player appearing on a solid yellow background.  Series 2 added the <i>500 Goal Club</i>, <i>League Leaders</i> (same design as the Series 1 Frequent All Star, but with a green background) and <i>Rookie Leaders</i>. Overall really not too bad, and stuffing all the sub-sets at the end of each series certainly kept the retro vibe going. Weirdly Pro Set decided checklist cards were lame, so there weren't any. Except in the mail-in set. Which was completely unnecessary because it was <strong>a)</strong> it was a Factory Set - you got every card, and <strong>2)</strong> there were only 25 cards, so even without a checklist it wouldn't have been too hard to keep track of missing cards.  
</p>
<p>
So to answer the question I posed above, did the set live up to it's heritage? It was a valiant effort, and there was some thought put into how the set should be structured, but ultimately the photography held it back from greatness. The rookie class is great, the design is not too bad, and the sub-sets are pretty decent. I could even live with the massive print runs. But I can't overlook the poor photography - the <i>raison d'être</i> of any card set - it's just a bridge too far. And so the set's Achilles Heel ultimately kills it for me.
