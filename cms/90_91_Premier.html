    Much has been said about the glorious 1990-91 O-Pee-Chee Premier set.  The relative limited quantity, the card design and quality
    and of course the clairvoyant rookien selection.  Jagr, Roenick, Fedorov, Modano, Sundin, Joseph, Bondra, Blake.  The list goes on.  To say this 
    set came out of left firld and lit the hobby on fire is an understatement.  The industry players knew what was coming in 1990-91 - new
    hockey entrant Upper Deck would bring a set similar to their ground-breaking 1989 Baseball set, we'd seen what Pro Set and Score was all about 
    also based on previous Baseball and Basketball sets, but to think O-Pee-Chee would use their "second set" allowed by the new NHL licensing 
    agreement to create one of the finest sets of the decade was beyond surprising.  To keep the exclusivity of the set, quantities were stricly 
    controlled - dealers were limited to a maximum of 5 cases each, and needed to "prove" that the majority of their sales was hockey cards.
    Geographically the set was limted to Canada only as well.

	<strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    What made the set great? Quality of the cards and quality of the players.  Premier was released in January 1991, giving OPC an oportunity to showcase
    not only the hot rookies of the season in actual game situations (rather than the typical draft or studio shots). In fact the top five picks from
    the 1990 draft were pictured on the ice, plus the cream of the '89 rookie class - Roenick, Jagr, Mogilny and Modano. The biggest miss?  Ed Belfour. It also allowed OPC to picture traded players in their new uniforms, rather than the airbrush hit jobs or
    "<i>now with Rangers</i>" on the card.  And of course the stars of the day were all here - Gretz, Yzerman, Roy, Lemieux. Quality was also several notches above what OPC had produced in 
    any previous year.  
<p>
    Card stock was was premium white stock and the design was crisp and minimal.  Player name, team & position out of the way at the 
    bottom of the card (no team logo) while the top of the card added to the premium feel with a gold banner displaying the yellow & red fade Premier logo 
    to the right, and the O-P-Chee name to the left.  And for the first time ever, a second player headshot appeared on the back, along with a very pared down 
    set of stats - name, position, '89-'90 season & full career stats.  Plus team logo. And while the back of the card was not glossy like Upper Deck,
    it didn't detract from the overall feel of the card. Clean, premium, sweet.

<p>
    But was it <i>truely</i> limited?  When the dust settled, the hobby slowly came to realise that no OPC product was <i>truely</i> limited.  And you lived through
    the heady, frothy days of early '90s Beckett-driven speculation and compare the card values back then vs. ut today, you know the answer.  Sure, PSA 10 Jagr RC
    commands good money, but the values of most of the others have dropped significantly from back then.</p>
<p>
    But what <i>hasn't</i> changed is the iconic position O-Pee-Chee Premier continues to hold today.  Great quality, great rookies, great player selection, all in a tight 132 card 
    set with no fluff. What else do you need? 1990-91 O-Pee-Chee Premier is by far my favorite set of the Junk Wax era.
