    The last few years of O-Pee-Chee '80s releases were a bit of a mixed bag in terms of production.  
    Between 1982-83 and 1984-85 production was rumoured to be way up (no factory sets yet, but there were 
    50-card "rack packs" and 500-card "vending" packs), with the '85-'85
    set being the worst offender.  Based on a contest they ran that year I calculate (very roughly) 
    that they produced the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Contest Odds were 1:662 of winning one of 10,000 prizes (mostly uncut sheets of cards)</li>
        <li>So roughly every 662nd pack was a winner, and there were 10,000 prizes </li>
        <li>That means O-Pee-Chee would have needed 6 620 000 packs to insert 10,000 instant winner cards</li>
        <li>With 15 cards in each pack we get 99,300,000 total cards printed</li>
        <li>Each set has 396 cards in it, so 99 million cards total would have created 250,757-ish total sets</li>
        <li>Each set has one of each card, giving us roughly a quarter million of each card</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Now it was runoured that O-Pee-Chee destroyed unsold cases, but that does not mean unsold cases sold to 
    distributors were destroyed - and in fact unopened cases and boxes continue to turn up

    On to the set review...
