    The last few years of O-Pee-Chee releases were a bit of a mixed bag in terms of production.  Between 1982-83 and 1984-85 products was rumoured to be way up, with the '85-'85
    set being the worst offender.  Based on a contest they ran that year I calculate (very roughly) that they produced roughly the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Contest Odds: 1:662 of winning one of 10,000 prizes (mostly uncut sheets of cards)</li>
        <li>Essentially every 662nd pack would spawn a winner x 10,000 = ~6 620 000 packs produced</li>
        <li>With 15 cards in each pack = 993,000,000,000 total cards would have been printed</li>
    </ul>
