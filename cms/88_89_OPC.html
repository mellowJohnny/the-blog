    The last few years of O-Pee-Chee '80s releases were a bit of a mixed bag in terms of production.  
    Between 1982-83 and 1984-85 production was rumoured to be "high".  There were no factory sets yet, but there were 
    51-card "rack packs" and 500-card "vending" packs in addition to the wax packs produced. The '84-'85
    set was the worst offender, and considered to be the final year of '80s over-production. Based on a contest 
    they ran that year I calculate (very roughly) that O-Pee-Chee produced almost 100 million cards for the '84-'85 set:
    <ul>
        <li>Odds of winning were 1:662, with 10,000 prizes (mostly uncut card sheets) available</li>
        <li>If roughly every 662nd pack was a winner, and there were 10,000 prizes, O-Pee-Chee would then have needed 6 620 000 packs to insert 10,000 instant winner cards</li>
        <li>With 15 cards in each pack we get 99,300,000 total cards printed</li>
        <li>Each set had 396 cards in it, so 99 million cards total would have created 250,757-ish total sets</li>
        <li>Each set has one of each card, so roughly a quarter million of each card</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Now it was runoured that O-Pee-Chee destroyed unsold cases, but that does not mean cases sold to 
    <i>distributors</i> which went unsold were destroyed - and in fact unopened cases and boxes are still not too hard to find
    almost 40 years later.

    On to the set review...
</p>
<p>
    The 1988-89 set comes in at 264 cards for the fourth year in a row (the Topps sister set in the US was identical to the first 198 cards in Canada, save for 
    a different Gretzky card) with no inserts, sub-sets, just standard player cards.  And the set starts off with a bang - 
    card #1 is Mario Lemieux.  I always liked when the first card was a super-star. Wax packs had just 7 cards per pack, making collecting this 
    set a bit of a chore.  Packs cost just &#162;0.35 at the time, with 48 packs in a box.  </p>
<p>
    '88-'89 was also a decent year for rookies, with one of the most feared snipers of the time in Brett Hull leading the class, plus Hall of Famers 
    Joe Nieuwendyk, Brendan Shanahan, & Pierre Turgeon.  The order of the set is a random assortment of players, no groupings and no 
    sub-sets like "Award Winners" or "In Action" or "League Leaders" cards like OPC usually did, meaning just one Gretzky and one Lemieux card in the set.</p>
<p>
    The set also includes the first piece of cardboard for minor stars Scott Mellanby, Ulf Dahlen, Darren Pang, 
    Ray Sheppard, Sean Burke, Glen Wesley, Bob Probert, Steve Duchesne, Dave Gagner, Uwe Krupp, Luke Richardson, & Petr Svoboda.
    We also saw the last hockey cards for Marcel Dionne, Billy Smith, Bob Gainey, Clark Gillies, & Hakan Loob

    I used to think the card design was about the worst I'd seen, with that sorta childish push-pin in the upper left corner 
    "pinning" the player's name to the card, with a dot-gradient "shadow" underneath.  Colours are bright and fluroescenty, with the border colour matching the main colour 
    of the team being represented.  Team logos appear to the right of the player name, putting everything you need to know at the top
    of the card, leaving the rest of the card for the player photo.  
<p>
    A subtle O-Pee-Chee logo appears in either the top right or bottom left of the photo, depending on the shot.  
    Overall the card design works pretty well actually.  The back of the card features the 
    standard-for-the-era player name, number, personal stats, complete NHL record, playoff record, and a little "human interest" blurb. 
    I could have done without the bright-ish orange & blue colour scheme, but it was 1988 after all.  Miami Vice was still on TV...

    The buzz around the lauch of this year's O-Pee-Chee set was....the Gretzky trade.  Believe me, we had still not recovered from the
    trade that shocked the hockey world that summer - Wayne Gretzky had been traded to the L.A. Kings.  The <i>Kings</i> for christsake!
    So the set was hypped as having Wayne's very first card sporting the black & silver Kings uni, taken during an on-ice phot shoot.  The 
    Topps version of the set shows Wayne holding his new jersey at a press conference, in what is now known as "The Sweater" card.
</p>
<p>
    Overall the set has held up quite well - not heavily over-produced, great crop of rookies, and a card design that both captures the 
    aesthetic of the times and still looks pretty good after 30+ years.  The Hull rookie is a great looking card, in all it's airbrushed glory. 
    Shanny's card is equally awesome, the Roy card is cool (look out for mis-printed "pink blocker" versions), and Kelly Hrudy's maskless mullet rocks.
    I'm a bit of a checklist fan, and the checklists are also pretty good looking cards, if not a bit bright. 
<p>
    And I'm partial to the smaller 264 card sets - really anything above that and you're getting 100 filler cards of journeyman players 
    whose Moms are the only ones who cared about their cards.  Best card in the set?  I'm going with Hull's rookie.  Worst card? The airbrush 
    hack-job on poor Paul MacLean. He deserved better.  Best goalie card?  Grant Fuhr.  <i>Best</i> Airbrush Job?  Mike Krushelnyski.  Nice job there.
</p>
<p>
    Overall the 1988-89 O-Pee-Chee set is quite nice - design is cool, rookie crop is excellent, production seemed descent, the photography
    is more often than not pretty good for the era. Taken as a whole it's quite a nice set, can be had in near-mint or better condition
    without breaking the bank, and would make a worthwhile addition to any collection.
