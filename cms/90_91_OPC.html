	By the time the 1990-91 rolled around he landscape of the hockey card market in Canada and the US had changed seismically. O-Pee-Chee and Topps no longer held monopolies in their respective markets.  The new NHL licensing deal was this: Upper Deck, Score and Pro Set had all been given the rights to produce two sets each, over the course of the season.  Upper Deck did a "Low" Series and a "High" series, Score did a regular set plus a mail-in "traded" set, while Pro Set did a Series I and Series II.  And somehow Score was also allowed to release a premium Pinnacle set, and Pro Set's premium set was issued under a resurrected Parkhurst brand with a Series I & II set.  So the market went from one set in 1989-90 to no less than six. And that's not including the Upper Deck or Parkhurst French sets. O-Pee-Chee had always been bilingual, and Score released a bilingual "Canadian" set (red Score logo) and an English "American" set (blue Score logo). And O-Pee-Chee stunned the market be releasing a single series O-Pee-Chee set and a super-limted 132 card premium set called O-Pee-Pee Premier as their 2nd set.  But more on that later...

	The 1990-91 O-Pee-Chee was their biggest set ever - a massive, meandering, over-produced set weighing in at 528 cards.  Plus a 22-card "Central Red Army" insert set.  And the Topps set was an equally massive (historically speaking) 396 card affair. Where to start...

	Rookies? You want rookies? How about 169 in the set.  Subsets? Sure - team cards, Award Winners, Highlights, we got it covered too.  Quality?  Sadly no.  Let's start with the card stock. Thin. They tried to do semi-premium with an all white stock (for the first time ever), but the cardboard was so thin it felt paper-like. And over time it has not held up too well, with a tendency for the backs to get weird brown spots all over them, looking like they've rusted. But hey, ya still got gum and a wax wrapper!

	Set was design was quite busy, especially compared with the realtively clean design of the year before.  Between the rounded rectangle at the bottom displaying the player and and position and the return of the hockey stick graphic at the top of the card, plaus a massive white border, there is not much room left for a photo.
