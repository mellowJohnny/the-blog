    The 1987-88 set was the year O-Pee-Chee reverted back to their old ways, after two seasons (the "Lemieux" and "Roy" seasons respectively) of relatively low-ish production. From the '87 season onwards things got a bit out of hand. Which is not to say that this set is unbcollectible - rather the opposite. I still prefer the pre-1990-91 sets becasue they were still quaint, they still had a bit of charm. The fact that O-Pee-Chee did not take production quality too seriously and took their monopolistic market position for granted to me created sets that are a bit more gratifying to collect. Putting a NRMT+ set together is a challenge exactly because card quality was so poor, and O-Pee-Chee didn't really care, until 1990 when they were foced to. Finding key rookie cards in mint condition is fairly easy, but finding the remaing commons can be far more challenging. Sometimes it's the journey, not the destination.

    <strong>On to the set review...</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Just like last year, the set size comes in at a very manageable 264 cards. Disappointingly though, no subsets. So key superstars in the set like Gretzky, Roy & Lemieux have just a single card. Good? Bad? Indifferent? Personally I'd rather see sub-sets. Who won the Jennings last year? Who won the Conn Smythe? Calder? Lady Bi...oh yeah, nobody cares. A lovely box-fresh wax pack would have set you back a whole 35 cents again, but you would have perhaps been disappointed to find just seven cards and some stale pepsin gum in the there. Oh well.

    As for rookies, this was yet another pretty strong year with the likes of super stars Luc Robitaille and Adam Oates, plus pugalist goalie Ron Hextall, Mike Vernon, Vincent Damphousse, Esa Tikkanen, Rick Tockett, Bill Ranford, future coach Gerard Gallant (even though Gerard was spelled Gerald), Kevin Hatcher, Craig Simpson, Gretzky's bodyguard Marty McSorley, super-pest Claude Lemieux and 50-goal scorer Stephane Richer. This was also the last time Mike Bossy, Denis Potvin, ironman Doug Jarvis (never missed a game in his entire career. Not one), and Richard Brodeur were immortalised on cardboard.

    Edmonton won the Cup in '87-'88, Gretzky was Playoff MVP, Lemieux's 168 points won him the scoring title, and 2011 Hall of Fame inductee (and pride of Oshawa!) Joe Nieuwendyk was Rookie of the Year.

    Design-wise I think it's one of the better ones from the '80s. Clean white border, hockey-stick graphic from left to right at the bottom of the card to hold the player name, with player position to the left and a puck to the right displaying the team logo. The rest of the card, save for a small O-Pee-Chee logo at the top on a black oval, was all photo. Nice clean design, with a kind a campy look to it. Photography is also quite good, arguably better than some sets of the early '90s (I'm lookin' at you Pro Set...) Also, 53 players sported moustanches on their cards that year. I guess they were all trying to look like Lanny McDonald. But only Lanny was Lanny.

    The back of the card is a pinkish-red with horizontally placed player stats - name, rank & serial number, plus regular season stats and a highlight blurb from last season..."Wayne led NHL in goals, assists, points, and short-handed goals (7)". Basically Wayne was playing pond hockey with the rest of the league. The set itself follows a similar pattern to years past - the first 198 cards are a mirror of the Topps set (which is why the checklists are almost always #197 and #198). Interestingly for Topps, since cards were printed on sheets of 132 cards each, it meant 66 of the cards in their set were double printed - there were no "half sheets" - so one full sheet of 132 + one sheet of 66 cards x 2. But back to the O-Pee-Chee set. Starting with card #199 we get the extra 132 O-Pee-Chee set exclusives, focusing on the Canadian teams. In some ways its a bit jarring, as the set is all of a sudden organised by team, starting with Edmonton, then continuing on to Calgary, Winnipeg, Montreal, Toronto, Quebec (minus two interlopers who had been recently traded to Washington), and Vancouver. Once again the O-Pee-Chee set was the only place to get your mitts on serveral rookie cards: Marty McSorley, Mike Vernon, Claude Lemieux, Stephane Richer, and Vincent Damphousse. These are some pretty big cards missing from the Topps set.

Overall the 1987-88 is another pretty strong O-Pee-Chee set. The design has held up decently well, the rookie crop is once again excellent, the photography is surprisingly good for the era. Other than the production numbers, it's quite a nice set, can be had in near-mint or better condition for somewhere around a couple hundred bucks, and would make a worthwhile addition to any collection.
