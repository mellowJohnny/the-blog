              <div class="flex-container, cards-intro">
                <p>If you are asking what "Junk Wax" let me take a moment to <i>wax</i> nostalgic for a moment...</p>
                <p>The Junk Wax era was a dark period in the history or sport card collecting, spanning roughly from the mid-80s to about 1993-94.  At the time everyone seemed to be collecting.
                  In Montreal where I grew up, card shops were eveywhere, there were multiple, competing cards shows every week-end (even mid-week shows became a thing), Beckett was the hockey 
                  card pricing bible (this was pre-internet of course) and collectors looked forward to each new monthly issue to see if the cards in their set had gone up or down.  
                  Counterfit cards - specifically Gretzky, Lemieux, Roy and Brett Hull rookies - were creeping into the hobby.</p>
                <p>And althought it was short-lived, it almost killed the hobby. Some cards companies didn't survive.  It also coinsides with the time I began collecting in earnest,
                  starting with the 1991-92 Upper Deck Hockey series...</p>
                 <p>What you will find below is a review of (almost) every hockey set from that era (even McDonalds!).  And while some look back on the Junk Wax era 
                  with distain, it hol;d fond memories for me, and more importantly, not all sets were "junk", many have stood the test of time to become little gems.
                  The sets & rookies form the era may not be helping put your kids through college, but there are still some nice, affordable sets left behind.  
                  And personally I find it disappointing that as a result of the bankruptcies & consolidations the hobby has basically collapsed into a single mega-card company - Upper Deck.  
                  So for me the Junk Wax era has one thing going for it - the sheer amount of choice & variety of sets at the time.  So dig in!
