              <div class="flex-container, cards-intro">
                <p>If you are wondering what the "Junk Wax" era is, let me <i>wax</i> nostalgic for a moment...</p>
                <p>The Junk Wax era was a dark period in the history of sport card collecting, spanning roughly from the late 80s to about 1993-94.  At the time everyone seemed to be collecting.
                  In the hockey mecca of Montreal where I grew up, card shops were eveywhere, there were multiple, competing cards shows every week-end (even mid-week shows became a thing), 
                  the Beckett price guide was the hockey card pricing bible (this was pre-internet of course) with millions of collectors looking forward to each new monthly issue to see if 
                  the cards in their set had gone up or down in value.</p>
                <p>Certain rookie cards were getting so expensive counterfeits began to appear - specifically Gretzky, Lemieux, Roy and 
                  Brett Hull rookies.  And crucially production numbers were astronimical.  While production numbers were a closely guarded secret (gee, I wonder why card companies would not 
                  want you to know that <i>millions</i> of your coveted Jaromir Jagr rookie card were printed?), some have estimated that <strong>billions</strong> of cards were produced each year, across all comapnies. 
                  Top of the market indeed.</p>
                <p>And althought it was short-lived, it almost killed the hobby. Card companies like Pro Set and O-Pee-Chee didn't survive.  It also coinsides with the time I began collecting in earnest,
                  starting with the 1991-92 Upper Deck Hockey series...</p>
                 <p>What you will find here is a review of (almost) every hockey set from that era (even McDonald's!).  And while some look back on the Junk Wax era 
                  with distain, it holds fond memories for me.  More importantly though, not all sets were "junk" - many have stood the test of time and have become little gems.</p>
                  <p>The sets & rookies from the era may not be helping put your kids through college, but there are still some nice, affordable sets to enjoy.  
                  And personally I find it disappointing that as a result of the bankruptcies & consolidations, the hobby has basically collapsed into a single mega-card company - Upper Deck.  
                  Ironically the explosion in sets which characterised the Junk Wax era also created what I think is it's biggest contribution to the hobby - the sheer amount of choice & variety of sets at the time.  So dig in!</p>
